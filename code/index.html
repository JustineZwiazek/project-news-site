              NASA scientists have hailed a "milestone decades in the making" as
              the giant mirror of its new space telescope was successfully
              unfurled.
            </p>
            <p class="big-news-text">
              The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) is the world's largest and
              most complex science telescope. It was successfully launched into
              space atop a European Ariane 5 rocket on December 25, 2021.
            </p>
            <p class="big-news-text">
              The $10 billion revolutionary space observatory - a joint effort
              between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space
              Agency — is designed to detect the faint infrared light from the
              earliest stars and galaxies formed over 13.5 billion years ago.
            </p>
            <p class="big-news-text">
              "It's a time machine," NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. "It's
              going to take us back to the very beginnings of the universe. We
              are going to discover incredible things that we never imagined.”
            </p>
            <p class="big-news-text">
              Initially NASA estimated that the James Webb Space Telescope could
              operate for at least five and a half years. Thanks to a seamless
              launch, this timeline has now been extended to 10 years. The
              lifespan of the telescope is up to the fuel reserves. Once fuel
              runs out, the JWST's mission will end.
