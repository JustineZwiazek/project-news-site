# News Site

This weekâ€™s project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I decided on the subject of the news site, and drew up a wire frame. I then proceeded to get a library of content (articles, pictures, logos) to use and added them to the wire-frame. I proceeded to add all of the contents in HTML, after which I styled the desktop version. Lastly I added media queries for tablet and mobile.
